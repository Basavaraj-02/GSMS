Developed a three-tier web application to streamline and automate grocery store operations. The system allows users to manage product inventories, place new orders, and add or update product details through a user-friendly interface.

The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a responsive and interactive user experience. The backend was developed using Python and Flask, handling business logic and routing. Data was stored and managed using a MySQL relational database.
